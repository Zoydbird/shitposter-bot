# Forked project

This project is forked from https://github.com/eon8ight/funpost-learner, with the intention of making it into a discord bot.



# Shitpost Learner

shitpost /SCHIT-pohst/ - a comment that contains nothing of intended value, but at the
same time is not intended to troll with.

This script uses Markov chains to learn how to shitpost. Using a user-specified board,
this script trains a Markov chain on all posts on all pages of said board and generates
shitposts on command. Also includes a random image from the same board. This doesn't
actually post to 4chan.

This makes extensive use of 4chan's read-only JSON API.

For a non-CLI version that runs in your browser, take a look at the [web branch](https://github.com/eon8ight/shitpost-learner/tree/web).

# Dependencies

* Python 3
* PyMarkovChain
* urllib

# How to Use

0. Install the required dependencies if you don't already have them.
1. Run `./shitposter.py`.
2. Enter a board to train on - ex. /a/, /b/, /co/, /tv/, etc.
3. Once training is finished, hit enter to generate a shitpost.

The command `train` will re-train the Markov chain on the same board.

The command `board <board>` will switch to the specified board.

The command `exit` will exit the script.
