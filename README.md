# Forked project

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/eon8ight/funpost-learner, with the intention of making it into a discord bot.

I've since re-hosted the repo, and have made some changes to the shitposter.py module, but full credit to the module still goes to https://github.com/eon8ight, and anyone that contributed to it.

# Info

There are some horrible things posted on 4chan, so if you would like to use this bot I apologise but take no responsibilty if it posts some of said horrible things.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, raise an issue for something you'd like added, or raise a pull request for something you have added!

# Dependencies

* Python 3
* PyMarkovChain

* discord.py
